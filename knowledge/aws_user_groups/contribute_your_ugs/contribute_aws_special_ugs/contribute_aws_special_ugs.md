# Special AWS User Groups

## Overview
Special AWS user groups are communities that focus on specific technologies, demographics, or interests within the AWS ecosystem. These groups often organize targeted meetups, workshops, and events to cater to their unique audience, providing a platform for members to share knowledge, network, and collaborate on specialized AWS topics.

### Types of Special User Groups
1. **Technology-Focused User Groups**: These groups concentrate on specific AWS technologies or services, such as serverless computing, machine learning, or DevOps. They provide deep dives into technical topics, hands-on workshops, and expert-led sessions to help members enhance their skills in particular areas.

2. **Women's User Groups**: These groups aim to support and empower women in the AWS community. They create a welcoming environment for women to connect, share experiences, and learn from each other. Events often include mentorship programs, career development workshops, and discussions on diversity and inclusion in tech.

By joining a special AWS user group, members can benefit from tailored content, connect with like-minded individuals, and gain insights specific to their interests or professional goals.

## Contributing to Our Knowledge Base

The template below is essential for anyone who wants to contribute to our knowledge base, initiated by the AWS User Group Vienna team. This team is responsible for organizing all AWS-related events in Austria and actively contributing to the AWS Community DACH.

### About Project Otto

Project OTTO - the meetup organizer bot - aims to create a comprehensive and structured repository of knowledge for AWS user groups. This project focuses on documenting best practices, event planning guides, and community engagement strategies to help AWS user groups thrive and grow.

This initiative leverages the open-source tool InstructLab to systematically organize and retrieve information, making it easier for user groups to access valuable insights and resources.

The foundation of this project was laid during several AWS Community Days in 2025, where Linda Mohamed and Philipp Bergsmann presented a session titled "From MacBook to Bedrock: Lessons from Building an AI Assistant." This session highlighted the importance of structured knowledge sharing and the practical steps taken to build and maintain this repository.

In this repository, we aim to create a comprehensive and structured taxonomy for AWS user groups. This initiative, started by the AWS User Group Vienna team, is essential for documenting best practices, event planning guides, and community engagement strategies. By leveraging the open-source tool InstructLab, we can systematically organize and retrieve information, making it easier for user groups to access valuable insights and resources.

The need for this taxonomy arises from the challenges we faced in managing and scaling our own user group activities. Consistent documentation and structured knowledge sharing are crucial for the growth and efficiency of any community. This repository serves as a centralized knowledge base, helping user groups to streamline their operations and enhance member engagement.

Contributing to this repository allows you to share your experiences and best practices with a broader audience, fostering a collaborative environment where everyone can benefit from shared knowledge. Your contributions will help in building a robust resource that supports the continuous improvement and success of AWS user groups worldwide.

By using this template, you can ensure that your contributions are consistent, detailed, and valuable to the broader AWS community.

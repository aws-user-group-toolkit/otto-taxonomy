# General AWS User Groups

## Overview
A general AWS user group is a community of AWS enthusiasts who come together to share knowledge, network, and collaborate on AWS-related topics. These groups often organize meetups, workshops, and other events to help members learn and grow their AWS skills.

## Contributing to Our Knowledge Base

The template below is essential for anyone who wants to contribute to our knowledge base, initiated by the AWS User Group Vienna team. This team is responsible for organizing all AWS-related events in Austria and actively contributing to the AWS Community DACH.

### About Project Otto

Project OTTO - the meetup organizer bot - aims to create a comprehensive and structured repository of knowledge for AWS user groups. This project focuses on documenting best practices, event planning guides, and community engagement strategies to help AWS user groups thrive and grow.

This initiative leverages the open-source tool InstructLab to systematically organize and retrieve information, making it easier for user groups to access valuable insights and resources.

The foundation of this project was laid during several AWS Community Days in 2025, where Linda Mohamed and Philipp Bergsmann presented a session titled "From MacBook to Bedrock: Lessons from Building an AI Assistant." This session highlighted the importance of structured knowledge sharing and the practical steps taken to build and maintain this repository.

In this repository, we aim to create a comprehensive and structured taxonomy for AWS user groups. This initiative, started by the AWS User Group Vienna team, is essential for documenting best practices, event planning guides, and community engagement strategies. By leveraging the open-source tool InstructLab, we can systematically organize and retrieve information, making it easier for user groups to access valuable insights and resources.

The need for this taxonomy arises from the challenges we faced in managing and scaling our own user group activities. Consistent documentation and structured knowledge sharing are crucial for the growth and efficiency of any community. This repository serves as a centralized knowledge base, helping user groups to streamline their operations and enhance member engagement.

Contributing to this repository allows you to share your experiences and best practices with a broader audience, fostering a collaborative environment where everyone can benefit from shared knowledge. Your contributions will help in building a robust resource that supports the continuous improvement and success of AWS user groups worldwide.

By using this template, you can ensure that your contributions are consistent, detailed, and valuable to the broader AWS community.

      AWS User Groups provide an informal, peer-to-peer learning environment to ask questions, network, and get inspired by real-world use cases. AWS supports user groups by listing them in the official directory and often connecting organizers with resources (speakers, event support, etc.). Many user groups focus on broad AWS topics, while some may cater to specific interests (e.g. serverless, AI/ML) depending on the local community's demand.

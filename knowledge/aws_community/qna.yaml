  - question: What role do AWS User Groups play in the broader AWS community?
    answer: AWS User Groups play a crucial role in the broader AWS community by fostering local communities of practice, enabling knowledge sharing, and providing networking opportunities for AWS enthusiasts of all levels.
  - question: What are AWS Community Days?
    answer: AWS Community Days are larger, day-long events that bring together multiple user groups for a series of talks, workshops, and networking opportunities. They are more comprehensive than regular meetups and often feature prominent speakers and hands-on labs.
  - question: How can I find an AWS User Group near me?
    answer: You can find an AWS User Group near you by visiting the AWS User Groups page on the AWS website or using platforms like Meetup.com to search for local groups. The AWS Community DACH page also lists user groups in the DACH region.

    answer: No, AWS community events are community-driven and not funded by AWS. All sponsorship activities are transparent, and there is no influence from any companies, including AWS, on the content of the meetups.
  - question: Why is it important to maintain independence as a user group?
    answer: Maintaining independence as a user group is important to ensure unbiased content, foster genuine community-driven discussions, and prevent commercial interests from overshadowing the group's educational and networking objectives. This helps build trust and credibility within the community.

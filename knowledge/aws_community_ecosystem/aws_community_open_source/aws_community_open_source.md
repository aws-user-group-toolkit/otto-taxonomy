# AWS Community Open Source

The AWS community is vibrant and active, with many members contributing to and developing open source projects. These projects often enhance the usability and functionality of AWS services, filling gaps and providing additional tools for users.

## Open Source Projects

One significant aspect of AWS community activity is the development and contribution to open source projects related to AWS. Examples include:

- **Serverless Frameworks:** Tools like the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) simplify the deployment and management of serverless applications.
- **CDK Libraries:** The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) allows developers to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Community-contributed libraries extend its capabilities.
- **Terraform Modules:** Terraform, an infrastructure as code tool, benefits from community-maintained modules that simplify AWS resource management.
- **Monitoring Dashboards:** Open source monitoring tools and dashboards, such as those built with Grafana, help users keep track of their AWS resources and applications.

Community-led open source tools often fill gaps and make it easier to use AWS services. Active contributors might organize themselves via GitHub and showcase their work at meetups.

## Community Contributions

AWS Heroes, recognized experts in the AWS community, are known to maintain popular open source repositories. For example, many Serverless Heroes contribute to the Serverless Framework and SAM community. This collaborative building is yet another way the community advances AWS usage collectively.

## Getting Involved

If you're interested in getting involved with the AWS open source community, here are some steps you can take:

1. **Join GitHub:** Many AWS open source projects are hosted on GitHub. Create an account and start exploring repositories.
2. **Attend Meetups:** Look for local or virtual AWS meetups where community members share their projects and experiences.
3. **Contribute to Projects:** Find a project that interests you and start contributing. This could be through code, documentation, or other means.
4. **Follow AWS Heroes:** Keep an eye on the work of AWS Heroes, who often lead and contribute to significant open source projects.

By participating in the AWS open source community, you can help advance the collective usage of AWS services and connect with like-minded individuals.

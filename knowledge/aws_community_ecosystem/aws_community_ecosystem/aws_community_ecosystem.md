# AWS Community Ecosystem

The AWS Community Ecosystem is a global, volunteer-driven network of AWS enthusiasts, user groups, and community-led initiatives. It connects individuals—ranging from cloud novices to experienced architects—who share a passion for learning, collaborating, and innovating on AWS.

## What Does the Ecosystem Include?

- **AWS User Groups:** Independent, community-organized gatherings of AWS builders who regularly meet online or in person. These groups provide a platform for members to share knowledge, discuss new AWS services, and collaborate on projects. User groups often host guest speakers, workshops, and hackathons to foster learning and innovation.

- **Leadership & Recognition Programs:** Various AWS-supported initiatives highlight top contributors and provide mentorship. Programs like AWS Heroes recognize individuals who have made significant contributions to the community through content creation, open-source projects, and community leadership. AWS Community Builders offers participants access to exclusive resources, mentorship opportunities, and a platform to share their expertise with a broader audience.

- **Community Events & Meetups:** Local meetups, virtual sessions, and larger conferences like AWS Community Days. These gatherings focus on sharing real-world solutions, demos, and best practices. AWS Community Days are organized by community leaders and provide an opportunity for attendees to learn from AWS experts, network with peers, and gain insights into the latest AWS trends and technologies.

AWS supports open-source projects through initiatives like the AWS Open Source Program, which encourages collaboration and innovation by providing resources and support to open-source contributors.

# AWS User Group Leader

Strong community leadership is the backbone of successful AWS user groups and programs. Community leaders are the **volunteers and advocates** who dedicate time to organize events, foster inclusive environments, and guide the growth of the community. This section covers what AWS community leadership entails, the responsibilities and best practices for leaders, and how AWS supports those leading community efforts.

## Roles and Responsibilities of Community Leaders
In AWS communities, *leadership* often refers to **user group leaders/organizers** as well as influencers like AWS Heroes or Community Builders who take on mentoring roles. A user group leader is typically the person (or team) that coordinates meetup logistics, decides on topics, finds speakers, and engages members. Key responsibilities include:

- **Organizing Regular Events:** Leaders schedule meetups or learning sessions (virtual or in-person) and handle all planning (see Event Planning). They secure venues or webinar platforms, set the agenda, and ensure events run smoothly.
- **Community Building:** Leaders actively grow the membership by promoting the group and welcoming newcomers. They might use social media, AWS community forums, and local networking to attract AWS users. During events, they facilitate introductions and discussions so members feel connected. Leadership often means **cultivating an environment where everyone feels included and encouraged to participate** ([Code of Conduct - AWS DMV Users Group](https://www.awsdmvusersgroup.org/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=1)).
- **Content Curation:** Deciding on relevant topics and finding quality speakers is a big part of leadership (see Speaker Selection). Leaders may survey members for interests or observe industry trends to choose meetup themes that provide value (e.g., a new AWS service launch, or a best practices session). They also coordinate with speakers on content and ensure it aligns with the group’s educational focus (avoiding marketing pitches).
- **Mentorship and Knowledge Sharing:** Many community leaders act as mentors or go-to experts for their members. They answer questions on forums or chat groups, help solve cloud problems, or point people to resources. For instance, an AWS Hero leading a user group might informally coach members pursuing AWS certifications. This **ongoing knowledge-sharing and support elevates the whole community’s skill level** ([AWS Heroes | Expert Cloud Community | AWS Developer Center](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/#:~:text=whose%20enthusiasm%20for%20knowledge,workshops%2C%20and%20user%20group%20events)).
- **Upholding Community Standards:** Leaders enforce the code of conduct and make sure the community stays a safe, welcoming space. They set the tone for respectful communication and quickly address any behavior that violates those standards. For example, a leader will remind participants to refrain from harassing or discriminatory behavior and will take action if someone does not comply ([Code of Conduct - AWS DMV Users Group](https://www.awsdmvusersgroup.org/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=,shared%20with%20members%20of%20the)). By modeling inclusive behavior and empathy, leaders ensure **everyone – regardless of gender, race, background or skill level – feels welcome to join and contribute** ([Code of Conduct - AWS DMV Users Group](https://www.awsdmvusersgroup.org/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=1)).
- **Administration and Continuity:** There are also behind-the-scenes duties like managing the group’s online page (Meetup.com or similar), sending event announcements, keeping track of RSVPs, and thanking sponsors. Good leaders plan for continuity – they might form a small organizing team or find co-leads to help distribute tasks. Having multiple organizers (or grooming new ones) ensures the group can continue even if one person gets busy or moves on.

## Best Practices for AWS Community Leaders
Effective community leadership in AWS circles has evolved with input from many experienced organizers, AWS Community Heroes, and the AWS community team. Some best practices include:

- **Know Your Audience & Adapt:** Great leaders listen to their members. Early on, it’s wise to poll the group about preferred meetup times and topics. For example, sending a simple questionnaire to pick the “best day” for meetups can boost attendance ([How to start your own AWS User Group aka Meetup? – lockhead.info](https://lockhead.info/index.php/2022/11/02/how-to-start-your-own-aws-user-group-aka-meetup/#:~:text=Before%20inviting%20your%20User%20Group,topics%20for%20the%20first%20sessions)). Gathering info on members’ AWS experience levels and interests helps tailor the content (e.g., more 101-level sessions if many are beginners, or advanced deep-dives if the crowd is senior engineers).
- **Consistency & Reliability:** Establish a regular cadence (e.g., first Tuesday of each month) so that the community builds a habit of attending. Even if turnout is small at first, consistency builds momentum. It’s better to have smaller regular meetups than sporadic large ones. Also, communicate clearly – leaders should post event details well in advance and send reminders. After events, they often share slides or recording links for those who couldn’t attend.
- **Inclusive Leadership Style:** A leader’s attitude sets the culture. Encouraging involvement, calling people by name, and showing genuine enthusiasm go a long way. Leaders often start events by explicitly stating that *everyone is here to learn and share, no question is “dumb”*, etc. Some leaders even share their personal career journey or challenges with AWS to break the ice. This vulnerability and openness can help others feel comfortable speaking up. As one community leader put it, they begin each event with *“clear table stakes about creating an inclusive space”* – inviting neurodiverse folks to privately request accommodations, assuring women they are respected, and making it clear that harassment won’t be tolerated ([You're running an online conference but get called out for having an all-male speaker lineup 2 days prior. Yo, What do you do? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/andrewbrown/youre-running-an-online-conference-but-get-called-out-for-having-an-all-male-speaker-lineup-2-days-prior-yo-what-do-you-do-2m58#:~:text=When%20I%27m%20running%20my%20AWS,about%20creating%20an%20inclusive%20space)).
- **Delegate and Empower Others:** While many user groups start as a one-person show, the most sustainable ones have a team. Leaders should identify enthusiastic members and ask them to help – whether as co-organizers, or just handling a single event’s logistics. Involving others not only lightens the load but also gives members a sense of ownership. For example, a leader might let a member coordinate a panel discussion or run an ice-breaker activity. This also trains the next generation of leaders.
- **Leverage AWS Support:** AWS has a Developer Relations and Community team that supports user group leaders behind the scenes. Once a group is established, AWS often **onboards the leader into the AWS User Group Leaders network (often a Slack channel or mailing list)** ([How to start your own AWS User Group aka Meetup? – lockhead.info](https://lockhead.info/index.php/2022/11/02/how-to-start-your-own-aws-user-group-aka-meetup/#:~:text=hear%20about%20your%20success%20story,I%20can%20improve%20this%20article)). Here, leaders globally swap tips and AWS staff share news or offer assistance. AWS can help with sourcing speakers (like connecting a relevant AWS expert or Hero to speak at your meetup) and may provide **promotional credits or swag** for events ([How to start your own AWS User Group aka Meetup? – lockhead.info](https://lockhead.info/index.php/2022/11/02/how-to-start-your-own-aws-user-group-aka-meetup/#:~:text=hear%20about%20your%20success%20story,I%20can%20improve%20this%20article)). For instance, AWS sometimes covers the Meetup.com organizer fees, sends t-shirts or stickers for attendees, and provides AWS credit codes to give away as door prizes. Smart leaders take advantage of these – it improves the event experience and signals to members that the group is recognized by AWS.
- **Recognition and Growth:** Leaders should publicize successes (like reaching 500 members, or hosting their first AWS Community Day). This can attract support from companies and AWS. AWS itself occasionally recognizes outstanding community leaders. For example, at re:Invent 2019, AWS gave Community Leadership Grants to select user group leaders to attend the conference as a thank-you for their service ([Celebrating AWS Community Leaders at re:Invent 2019](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/celebrating-aws-community-leaders-at-reinvent-2019/#:~:text=The%20following%20attendees%20received%20Community,LinkedIn%2C%20Twitter%29)). Being vocal about the impact of your community (number of people educated, etc.) can lead to such opportunities. It also inspires other members to step up and contribute, seeing the tangible benefits of community work.
- **Continuous Learning:** Good leaders don’t need to be the top AWS expert in the room, but they should continuously learn and stay updated. This ensures they remain relevant and can identify valuable topics or correct misinformation in discussions. Many leaders are themselves motivated by the learning aspect – running a community pushes them to keep their AWS knowledge sharp. They often attend AWS webinars, get certifications, or join programs like Community Builders to bolster their expertise ([AWS Community Builders | Worldwide Cloud Community | AWS Developer Center](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/#:~:text=Interested%20AWS%20builders%20should%20apply,Heroes%2C%20and%20the%20AWS%20community)), which in turn benefits their group.

## Building an Inclusive and Sustainable Community
A core trait of effective community leadership is a focus on **inclusion, diversity, and sustainability**:

- **Code of Conduct Enforcement:** As mentioned, leaders uphold a code of conduct. Many AWS communities adopt or adapt the “AWS User Group Code of Conduct” which mirrors open-source community guidelines ([Code of Conduct - AWS DMV Users Group](https://www.awsdmvusersgroup.org/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=1)) ([Code of Conduct - AWS DMV Users Group](https://www.awsdmvusersgroup.org/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=,shared%20with%20members%20of%20the)). This typically includes expectations like: be respectful, listen to others, no harassment, and report issues to organizers. Leaders should make this visible (on the group’s page and/or announced at events) so all participants understand the ground rules. In case of violations (e.g., someone making inappropriate comments), leaders must act decisively – issuing warnings or banning repeat offenders. This maintains trust that the community is safe for everyone.
- **Encouraging Diverse Voices:** Leaders play a role in diversifying the community. For instance, they can reach out to underrepresented groups (women, LGBTQ+, underrepresented minorities, etc.) to invite them to attend or speak. Some ways include partnering with diversity-focused tech groups (like Women in Tech chapters, or organizations like Girls in Tech), or ensuring that event marketing uses inclusive language and imagery. When members see diversity in leadership or speaker lineup, it sends a welcoming signal. Leaders should also be mindful of factors like meeting location (is it accessible via public transit? is the venue accessible for those with disabilities?) and timing (rotating event days so people with different schedules can attend). Small things – e.g., providing a childcare stipend or interpreting service for hearing-impaired attendees – can make a big difference in inclusivity if the group has the means.
- **Community Feedback Loop:** Sustainable communities evolve based on member feedback. Leaders might do occasional feedback surveys or simply chat with attendees to ask “what did you think of this meetup?” and “what topics do you want next?”. Being receptive to feedback (and implementing good suggestions) shows members that the community is *theirs* too, not just the leader’s pet project. Over time, this encourages loyalty and active participation. It also prevents stagnation – new ideas keep the community fresh.
- **Mentoring New Leaders:** As a community matures, leaders should identify potential successors or co-leaders. This could be someone who consistently volunteers or a member particularly passionate about AWS. Mentoring them in organizational skills and gradually giving them more responsibilities ensures the community isn’t dependent on a single individual. For example, a founder of a user group might after a year or two take a back seat and let a newer organizer take charge of programming, while still advising. AWS community history has many examples of groups that continued for years because leadership was handed off smoothly.

## AWS Support and Networking for Leaders
AWS values its community leaders and has mechanisms to support them:
- **AWS Community Network:** AWS runs an official portal (community.aws) and Slack where leaders globally connect. They share best practices documents (there’s even an infographic of “Community Best Practices” compiled from seasoned user group leaders, Heroes, and Builders) and can ask questions from AWS community managers. New leaders can learn a lot from this global network, accelerating their group’s growth by applying lessons learned elsewhere.
- **Mentorship by AWS Heroes/Core Team:** Some regions have mentor programs. For example, the AWS Community Day “Core Team” consists of veteran community leaders who mentor newer organizers in how to run a successful larger event ([AWS Community Day Global Events | 2025](https://aws.amazon.com/events/community-day/#:~:text=)). While this specifically is for Community Day conference planning, the concept extends to regular meetups too: new user group leaders can reach out to AWS Heroes or experienced organizers in their area for advice. Most Heroes and Builders are quite approachable and happy to help (since they too often started small). AWS facilitates this by maintaining directories and profiles – you can **“connect with a Hero near you”** via the official AWS Hero directory ([AWS Heroes | Expert Cloud Community | AWS Developer Center](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/#:~:text=or%20click%20on%20a%20profile,near%20you%20or%20visit%20our)).
- **Resource Kits:** AWS occasionally provides user group leaders with resource kits – this might include slide templates with the latest AWS updates (so leaders can share official news easily), credits for things like Amazon QuickSight (if needed to analyze member data), or merchandise packs for special occasions (e.g., giveaways to celebrate AWS’s birthday or similar). Some AWS teams also give leaders early access to workshops or demos that they can run locally.
- **Events for Leaders:** AWS re:Invent and some AWS Summits often have a special meetup or workshop for user group leaders. These sessions allow leaders to meet AWS developer relations staff and exchange ideas with each other. They sometimes also recognize standout leaders publicly at these events.

In summary, AWS community leadership is about **service to the community** – amplifying others’ knowledge and fostering connections. It requires organization, empathy, and passion. Those who do it well find it to be incredibly rewarding: they not only see their own professional network and skills grow, but they also witness firsthand how a supportive community can **transform careers and spark innovation**. As one AWS user group leader noted, engaging actively in an AWS community can fundamentally change your cloud journey for the better ([AWS | Community | AWS Community: How User Groups Transformed My Cloud Career](https://community.aws/content/2rHOQSsrlJQ16BrdW5mL37s0vaS/aws-community-how-user-groups-transformed-my-cloud-career?lang=en#:~:text=Have%20you%20ever%20thought%20about,began%20to%20transform%20in%202023)), and it’s the leaders who enable that magic to happen.

# AWS User Group First-Timer Badge

## Overview
The **User Group First-Timer** badge is designed to identify attendees who are participating in an AWS User Group meetup for the first time. This badge serves as an invitation for existing members to welcome them and for leaders to ensure they have a great first experience.

## Purpose
The primary goal of the First-Timer badge is to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers. By clearly identifying first-timers, the badge encourages experienced members to engage with them, offer assistance, and make them feel part of the community.

## Badge Design
The First-Timer badge is visually distinct to ensure it stands out. It typically includes the following elements:
- **Color**: A unique color that differentiates it from other badges.
- **Text**: Clearly labeled with "First-Timer" to indicate the attendee's status.
- **Icon**: An optional icon that symbolizes a warm welcome or new beginnings.

## Implementation

### Printing Badges
- **Templates**: A PDF template for printing badges on Avery L3415 stickers is available in the templates directory. This allows for easy distribution at event registration.
- **Digital Files**: High-quality PNG files of the First-Timer badge are available in the src directory for digital use or professional printing.

### Usage Tips
- **Briefing Session**: Conduct a quick briefing with your team before the event to ensure everyone understands the importance of welcoming first-timers.
- **Introduction**: During the welcome speech, explain the badge system and highlight the First-Timer badge. Encourage attendees to interact with first-timers and make them feel included.
- **Follow-Up**: After the event, gather feedback from first-timers to understand their experience and identify areas for improvement.

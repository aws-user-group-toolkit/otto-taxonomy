      The **User Group First-Timer** badge is designed to identify attendees who are participating in an AWS User Group meetup for the first time. This badge serves as an invitation for existing members to welcome them and for leaders to ensure they have a great first experience. The primary goal of the First-Timer badge is to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers. By clearly identifying first-timers, the badge encourages experienced members to engage with them, offer assistance, and make them feel part of the community. The badge is visually distinct to ensure it stands out, typically including a unique color, clear "First-Timer" text, and an optional icon. Templates for printing badges on Avery L3415 stickers and high-quality PNG files are available for digital use or professional printing. Usage tips include conducting a briefing session, explaining the badge system during the welcome speech, and gathering feedback from first-timers after the event. This badge system is part of a community project initiated by the AWS Meetup Vienna, Austria, and is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by AWS.

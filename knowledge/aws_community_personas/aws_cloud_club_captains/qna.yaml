      A Cloud Captain is a student who has been chosen (through a competitive application process) to start and lead an AWS Cloud Club at their college/university. They act as the president/organizer of the club, responsible for planning activities like study sessions, AWS workshops, tech talks, and even local mini hackathons or AWS Community Days for students. Cloud Captains receive direct support from AWS’s student advocacy team – they get guidance on how to run the club, resources for learning, and mentorship to develop their leadership skills. Captains also enjoy some perks such as AWS Certification vouchers, resume review sessions, invites to AWS webinars, and cool swag to help attract club membership. This support helps them succeed in not only improving their own AWS skills but also empowering dozens or hundreds of fellow students on campus.

      The clubs are entirely focused on learning and community building. Typical Cloud Club activities might include AWS 101 bootcamps for beginners, hands-on labs in things like building a web app on AWS, sessions on cloud career guidance, and guest lectures possibly by AWS Heroes or community experts (virtually). A key aspect is that no one is selling AWS or charging fees – it’s purely about skills development and community growth. By participating, students gain practical cloud experience in a collaborative environment and can showcase their work (projects, presentations) which is great for their resumes.

      AWS runs this as a cohort-based program. This means not every campus has a club yet, but AWS is expanding the program. Students interested in starting a club must go through an application, demonstrating leadership experience and AWS knowledge, and even get their university’s support for the club. The exclusivity ensures committed leaders. AWS Cloud Clubs are quickly becoming a cornerstone of the student developer community in cloud – they create a pipeline of cloud-fluent graduates and strengthen the overall AWS community by bringing in new, young talent.

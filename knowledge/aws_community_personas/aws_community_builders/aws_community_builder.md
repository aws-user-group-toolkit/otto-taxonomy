# AWS Community Builders Program 

The AWS Community Builders program offers emerging community enthusiasts a pathway to deepen their AWS knowledge, expand their network, and increase their reach as thought leaders. Community Builders are typically **AWS practitioners (developers, architects, etc.) who are passionate about sharing AWS knowledge** – perhaps through blogging, speaking at meetups, creating tutorials, or contributing to open source. The program is open to applicants worldwide and seeks a diverse cohort of individuals who **actively create content or help others learn AWS**.

## What is a Community Builder?

A Community Builder is an AWS practitioner who actively shares their AWS knowledge and expertise with the broader community. They create content such as blog posts, tutorials, and videos, speak at events, contribute to open source projects, and engage in forums and social media to help others learn and grow with AWS.

## What the Program Provides

Accepted Community Builders gain access to a wealth of resources from AWS, including:

- **Technical resources & education:** Members get exclusive webinars and sessions with AWS subject matter experts who share insights on new services and best practices. This helps builders stay at the forefront of AWS tech.
- **Mentorship:** AWS experts and Heroes provide guidance on how to effectively create technical content and grow one’s influence in the community. Builders can ask questions and learn directly from AWS teams.
- **Networking opportunities:** Builders connect with each other (and with Heroes and AWS teams), forming a global network of like-minded AWS enthusiasts. There are active discussions and knowledge exchange within the Builders’ private channels.
- **AWS credits and swag:** Participants receive promotional credits to experiment with AWS (which helps in building demos or writing tutorials) and often other perks (like training vouchers, cool swag, etc.) to support their community work.

## How to Apply

The program runs in cohorts (annual or biannual intakes). Selection is based on an application highlighting one’s contributions (blog posts, talks, answers on forums, etc.), with emphasis on quality, accuracy, and impact of content. AWS specifically encourages **people from all regions and underrepresented demographics to apply**, ensuring the community builder pool remains diverse and inclusive.

## When to Apply

Applications for the AWS Community Builders program typically open once or twice a year. Interested individuals should keep an eye on the [AWS Community Builders page](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) for announcements regarding application periods.

## Categories

Community Builders can specialize in various categories, including but not limited to:

- AI/ML
- Analytics
- Application Development

- DevOps

- Security

## Where Community Builders Are and What They Do

Community Builders are located worldwide and engage in a variety of activities to share their AWS knowledge. They write blog posts, create video tutorials, speak at conferences and meetups, contribute to open source projects, and participate in online forums and social media discussions. Their goal is to help others learn and succeed with AWS, fostering a vibrant and supportive community.

## Conclusion

Once in the program, Community Builders are expected to continue their community activities – e.g., writing blog posts, speaking at events, and generally “paying it forward” by helping others learn AWS. In return, AWS amplifies their voice (for instance, by sharing top content on official channels) and provides a supportive environment for them to grow as community leaders. Many AWS Heroes were originally Community Builders who matured their contributions over time, highlighting this program as a **stepping stone to deeper community leadership**.

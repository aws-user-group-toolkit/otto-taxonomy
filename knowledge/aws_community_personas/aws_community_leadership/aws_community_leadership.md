# AWS Community Leadership Principles

The AWS Community Leadership Principles are inspired by Amazon's Leadership Principles but tailored to foster a collaborative and inclusive community. Here are some key principles and the goals of different leaders within the AWS community:

## Amazon's Leadership Principles

1. **Customer Obsession**: Leaders start with the community and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep community trust.
2. **Ownership**: Leaders act on behalf of the entire community, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”
3. **Invent and Simplify**: Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their community members and always find ways to simplify.
4. **Are Right, A Lot**: Leaders have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
5. **Learn and Be Curious**: Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
6. **Hire and Develop the Best**: Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the community.
7. **Insist on the Highest Standards**: Leaders continually raise the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes.
8. **Think Big**: Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve the community.
9. **Bias for Action**: Leaders value calculated risk-taking. Speed matters in business.
10. **Frugality**: Leaders accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention.
11. **Earn Trust**: Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.
12. **Dive Deep**: Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, and audit frequently. No task is beneath them.
13. **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**: Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. They have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
14. **Deliver Results**: Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion.

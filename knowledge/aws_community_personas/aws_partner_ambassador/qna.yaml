      The AWS Ambassador Program is a community initiative within the AWS Partner Network (APN) that recognizes and empowers AWS experts who work at AWS Partner companies. These individuals (called AWS Ambassadors) are usually solutions architects, engineers, or technical leads at consulting firms or ISVs that are AWS Partners. Ambassadors are passionate AWS advocates within their organizations and externally. They are typically AWS Certified professionals who have proven technical expertise and a track record of knowledge-sharing.

      The AWS Ambassador Program builds a community of AWS professionals who are thought leaders at their companies. Ambassadors are considered an extension of AWS within the partner ecosystem – they help drive cloud adoption and proficiency both inside their company and for customers. To become an Ambassador, one must be an employee of an APN Partner, have multiple AWS certifications, and contribute to the community (e.g., writing blog posts, speaking at events, building solutions). The program is somewhat analogous to AWS Heroes, but exclusive to the partner context.

      AWS Ambassadors spend a significant amount of time on knowledge sharing and community engagement. They might host lunch-and-learn sessions internally, lead AWS workshops for customers, speak at AWS events or user groups, publish technical articles or whitepapers, and so forth. In doing so, they elevate the expertise within their company (making the partner more capable) and also contribute valuable content to the broader AWS user base. Ambassadors often collaborate with AWS teams to get the latest updates and sometimes co-present in events.

      While both Heroes and Ambassadors are AWS champions, Ambassadors are partner-focused (driving AWS adoption in customer projects and within their companies), whereas Heroes are community-focused at large.

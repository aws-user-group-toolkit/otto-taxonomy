The **AWS Community Ecosystem** is a global, grassroots network of AWS enthusiasts—ranging from cloud professionals and students to hobbyists—who gather to learn, build, and share knowledge about AWS. This community-driven initiative supports continuous learning and empowers members to grow through meetups, events, open-source collaboration, and recognition programs.

# AWS User Groups

## Introduction
AWS User Groups (UGs) are **community-led** groups where cloud builders of all levels gather to discuss the latest AWS technologies, share experiences, and learn from peers. These groups provide a platform for individuals to connect, collaborate, and grow their knowledge in AWS services and solutions. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced professional, AWS User Groups offer valuable opportunities to enhance your skills and network with like-minded individuals.

## Global Reach
There are over **590+ AWS User Groups globally** ([User Groups - Community Events - AWS Developer Center](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/usergroups/)), spanning cities and regions worldwide. User Group events are typically free and occur regularly (monthly or quarterly), either in-person or virtual. Each group is organized by volunteer leaders who coordinate meetups featuring tech talks, demos, or workshops.

## Key Features
AWS User Groups provide an informal, peer-to-peer learning environment to ask questions, network, and get inspired by real-world use cases. AWS supports user groups by listing them in the official directory and often connecting organizers with resources (speakers, event support, etc.). Many user groups focus on broad AWS topics, while some may cater to specific interests (e.g. serverless, AI/ML) depending on the local community's demand.

### Knowledge Sharing and Networking
User Groups enable knowledge sharing and networking on a local level. Discussions range from new AWS service announcements to best practices and member project showcases. Meetings often include one or two presentations followed by Q&A and a networking session. The atmosphere is typically welcoming and vendor-neutral – **no sales pitches or recruiting**, just builders helping each other learn (more on content guidelines in Speaker Selection).

### Learning and Professional Growth
Joining a user group is an excellent way to **learn tangible AWS skills from like-minded peers and build your professional network** ([User Groups - Community Events - AWS Developer Center](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/usergroups/)). By participating in these groups, members can stay updated with the latest AWS developments, gain insights from real-world implementations, and find inspiration for their own projects.

## Conclusion
AWS User Groups are a vital part of the AWS community, fostering collaboration and continuous learning. Whether you are looking to deepen your AWS knowledge, share your experiences, or connect with other cloud enthusiasts, joining an AWS User Group can be a rewarding experience.

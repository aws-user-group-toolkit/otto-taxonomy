2. **Schedule the Event on Meetup.com**: 
    - Create a new event on your AWS user group's Meetup.com page.
    - Provide a detailed description of the pubquiz, including the date, time, and location (virtual or physical).
    - Encourage members to register and form teams in advance.

3. **Promote the Event**: Use social media, email newsletters, and other communication channels to spread the word about the pubquiz. Highlight the fun and educational aspects to attract more participants.

    - Divide participants into teams if they haven't already formed them.

    - Keep track of scores and announce the winners at the end of the event.

5. **Follow Up**: After the event, share the answers and any additional resources or explanations for the questions. Thank participants for joining and encourage them to attend future meetups.

### Benefits of an AWS Community Pubquiz

Organizing an AWS Community Pubquiz is an amazing opportunity for teams to get to know each other better and identify their strengths. This collaborative environment fosters teamwork and helps participants learn from each other.

- **Encourage Participation**: Motivate all team members to contribute by creating an inclusive and supportive atmosphere. Highlight the importance of teamwork and collective problem-solving.

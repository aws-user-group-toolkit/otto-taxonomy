### **Drink Options**

As we're hosting after-work events, it’s important to offer a balanced mix of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, with options for sparkling and still varieties.

- **Non-Alcoholic Drinks**:  
   - **Water**: Offer still and sparkling water. Serve both types to cater to everyone’s preference. You can provide water in bottles or dispensers with cups.
   - **Juices**: Freshly squeezed orange juice, apple juice, and a tropical juice mix (pineapple, mango, and passion fruit).
   - **Soft Drinks**: Cola, lemonade, or other soda options.  
   - **Tea/Coffee**: Offer both hot tea (herbal or black) and coffee. Consider offering iced tea for warmer weather.

- **Alcoholic Drinks**:  
   - **Beer**: Light beers (e.g., pilsner, lager) and dark beers (e.g., stout, porter) to provide variety.  
   - **Radler**: A refreshing mix of beer and lemon soda, ideal for after-work events.
   - **Wine**: A selection of red and white wines. Opt for light whites (e.g., Sauvignon Blanc) and fruity reds (e.g., Pinot Noir).
   - **Prosecco**: For a more festive touch, offer prosecco (a sparkling wine) that adds a celebratory vibe to the event.

   - **Serving Suggestions**:  
     - Alcoholic beverages should be served in moderation to create a relaxed yet professional atmosphere.
     - Consider offering drink stations where people can help themselves, as well as having a bartender or host to ensure everyone is served responsibly.

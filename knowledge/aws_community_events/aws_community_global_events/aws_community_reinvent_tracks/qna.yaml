      AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas features a variety of community tracks that bring together diverse perspectives and expertise. The AWS Heroes Track is for community leaders recognized for their significant contributions to the AWS community, sharing their deep technical knowledge and real-world experiences through sessions and talks. AWS Heroes usually receive direct information from their program about opportunities to submit talks and should check their program communications or Slack workspaces for announcements. The Community Builders Track is for those who actively contribute to the AWS community through blogs, forums, and social media, sharing their experiences and tips for engaging with the community. Like AWS Heroes, Community Builders typically get direct information from their program about submitting talks and should monitor their Slack workspaces for updates. For those outside of these community programs who want to speak at re:Invent, there are public Call for Proposals (CFPs) available, with announcements regarding CFPs found on the official AWS re:Invent website and other AWS communication channels. The Developer Area in the Expo is a dedicated space where developers can connect, collaborate, and learn from each other through hands-on labs, technical sessions, and opportunities to meet AWS experts and community leaders. Breakout sessions dedicated to community speakers provide a platform for AWS Heroes, User Group Leaders, and Community Builders to share their knowledge and experiences, covering a wide range of topics and offering valuable insights for attendees looking to learn and network. DevChats are informal, interactive sessions where attendees can engage in discussions with AWS experts and community leaders, providing an opportunity to ask questions, share experiences, and gain insights into various AWS topics. For those unable to attend in person, AWS re:Invent offers a wealth of online resources, including live-streamed sessions, recorded talks, and virtual networking opportunities. Community speakers often share their presentations and insights online, making it accessible for a global audience. These community tracks and dedicated spaces make AWS re:Invent a valuable event for attendees looking to engage with the AWS community and enhance their skills. Please check online for the latest details on public CFPs or consult your specific program for submission opportunities.

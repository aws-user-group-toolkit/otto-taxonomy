Dear [Manager],

I’d like to attend AWS Community Day Romania 2025, on April 10th, in Timisoara at Iulius Congress Hall. This is a great opportunity for me to learn about the latest cloud technologies, gain in-demand skills and explore how AWS can benefit our projects. It will also help me build meaningful connections with the local and global cloud community.

Here are some of the activities I’m excited to participate in:

- Attend over 10 technically competent talks packed with insights that will fuel my professional growth. I will explore AWS services and learn how to implement them in real-world scenarios, even if we are not currently using AWS. This knowledge can help us identify new approaches to solving challenges or enhancing efficiencies in our projects.
- Engage in discussions in an exceptional venue offering enough space for networking and engaging in talks with people with similar interests. Building relationships with experts and peers will give us access to industry best practices and creative solutions we can adapt for our context.
- Interact with over 400 diverse attendees and speakers, including leading experts from AWS User Group communities. The interactive sessions, lively discussions and fresh perspectives gained during these interactions can inspire new ideas and strategies that align with our goals.

Attending this conference will directly benefit the company in several ways:

- Expanding our technical knowledge: Insights from the conference can help us evaluate whether AWS services or similar tools could improve our workflows or address specific challenges.
- Team skill development: After the event, I will share what I’ve learned with the team and propose actionable steps for incorporating new skills and practices. This ensures the whole team benefits from my participation.
- Identifying innovative solutions: By engaging with global cloud leaders and understanding their approaches, I’ll be better equipped to identify cutting-edge solutions that align with our company’s needs.
- Strategic networking: Establishing connections with AWS experts and peers could open doors to collaborations, partnerships or resources that could enhance our projects and business outcomes.

Here’s a breakdown of estimated costs:
- Domestic round-trip airfare Bucharest/Iasi/Chisinau - Timisoara 09-11 April (subject to airline prices and availability): 100€
- Hotel: 60-80€/night
- Registration fee: 24€
- Total: 300-360€

Following the conference, I’ll schedule time with our team to share what I learned, train my team on new technology and skills, and propose a plan to implement my learnings to drive results against our company’s goals.

Thank you for considering my request to attend this event. I’m really excited about this opportunity and look forward to your reply.

[your name]

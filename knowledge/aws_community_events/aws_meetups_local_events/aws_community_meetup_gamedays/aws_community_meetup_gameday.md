# AWS Community User Group GameDay Meetup

## Overview

An AWS Community User Group GameDay is a collaborative event organized by multiple AWS user groups to provide a hands-on, gamified learning experience. These events are designed to bring together AWS enthusiasts to tackle real-world challenges in a competitive yet risk-free environment.

## Initiating a Collaborative GameDay

### Concept

A collaborative AWS GameDay involves multiple user groups coming together to create a unified event. This can be initiated by any user group or a regional community organization. The goal is to provide a larger, more diverse experience for participants, fostering cross-group collaboration and learning.

### Steps to Initiate

1. **Form a Planning Committee**: Include representatives from each participating user group.
2. **Set a Date and Format**: Decide on a date and whether the event will be fully virtual, hybrid, or in-person.
3. **Define Roles and Responsibilities**: Assign tasks such as event coordination, technical setup, and communication.
4. **Create a Central Communication Channel**: Use platforms like Slack or Discord for coordination.
5. **Promote the Event**: Use social media, mailing lists, and meetup platforms to reach potential participants.

### Example Initiative: Förderverein AWS Community DACH and AWS User Group Vienna

The Förderverein AWS Community DACH, in collaboration with the AWS User Group Vienna, is organizing a hybrid AWS GameDay on May 8, 2025. This event aims to unite various AWS User Groups within the DACH region (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) for a day of learning, collaboration, and fun.

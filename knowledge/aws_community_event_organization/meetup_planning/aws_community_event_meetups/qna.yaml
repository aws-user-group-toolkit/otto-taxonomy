      Start by deciding how often to hold meetups (e.g., monthly, bi-monthly) and whether they will be in-person, virtual, or hybrid. Many groups found that a 4-8 week cadence works well – frequent enough to maintain interest but not so frequent that organizers or attendees burn out. Use a poll or questionnaire to identify the best day and time for most members.

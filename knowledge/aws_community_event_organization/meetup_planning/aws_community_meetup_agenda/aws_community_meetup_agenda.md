# Agenda and Content Planning

Plan an agenda for each meetup and publish it beforehand on your event invite page. A typical meetup agenda might be:  
- **Welcome & News (5-10 min):** The organizer welcomes everyone, briefly introduces what the AWS user group is for newcomers, and shares any relevant AWS updates or community announcements (e.g., upcoming AWS Summit or new certification launches).  
- **Presentation(s) (20-30 min each):** One or two main talks on AWS topics. It’s good to have a mix over time – e.g., one month a deep-dive into a specific service (like Amazon S3 best practices), another month a higher-level case study (like how Company X built a solution on AWS). Ensure the topics align with your members’ interests. Early on, you might have to rely on yourself or close colleagues to speak (more on finding speakers in Speaker Selection). In the first meetup, if you’re unsure what level to target, aim for a middle-ground topic and explicitly invite feedback (“Was this too basic or too advanced? What would you like to hear about next?”). Also, don’t shy away from introductory topics: new AWS users greatly appreciate clear foundational talks, and even experienced folks often enjoy refreshers or seeing how others approach basics.  
- **Q&A (after each talk, 5-10 min):** Facilitate a question period. As an organizer, be ready to spark the Q&A by asking a question yourself if the audience is shy initially. This encourages others to chime in.  
- **Lightning Talks or Member Shout-outs (optional, 5 min):** Some groups allow a couple of members to make brief announcements – e.g., someone might share a cool open-source tool they found, or invite people to an upcoming hackathon. If you include this, set clear time limits and vet announcements to keep them relevant.  
- **Networking Session (30+ min):** After the formal talks, encourage attendees to stick around and mingle. In person, this is where you offer pizza, snacks, drinks provided by a sponsor or host. The casual conversation is often where connections form and people discuss what they heard in the talks. Virtually, you could simulate this by using breakout rooms or just having an open discussion where people can unmute and chat. One organizer recounted that they held a second meetup in a **beer garden with no formal talks, 100% focused on networking** – which was a great success in building relationships ([How to start your own AWS User Group aka Meetup? – lockhead.info](https://lockhead.info/index.php/2022/11/02/how-to-start-your-own-aws-user-group-aka-meetup/#:~:text=part%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9Cnetworking%E2%80%9D%20session)). So, don’t underestimate the value of unstructured social time in your events.

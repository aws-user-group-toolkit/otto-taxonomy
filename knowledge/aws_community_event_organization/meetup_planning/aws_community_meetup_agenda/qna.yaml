      AWS Community Meetups are organized events where AWS enthusiasts gather to share knowledge, network, and collaborate on AWS-related topics. These meetups typically feature presentations from AWS experts, hands-on workshops, and opportunities for attendees to discuss their experiences and challenges with AWS services. The agenda for a typical AWS Community Meetup includes an introduction, keynote presentations, breakout sessions, networking breaks, Q&A sessions, and a closing session. Each session is carefully timed to ensure a smooth flow of events, with keynote presentations usually lasting around 45 minutes, breakout sessions around 30 minutes, and Q&A sessions around 15 minutes.

  - AWS Community Event Sponsorship includes various types of sponsors such as corporate sponsors, local businesses, and individual contributors. Corporate sponsors provide significant funding and resources, local businesses offer venue space and catering services, and individual contributors support through smaller donations and volunteer work. Associations with formal organizations can provide credibility and access to a broader network but may come with additional requirements and bureaucracy, while organizing without formal associations can be more straightforward and flexible. AWS Community Days are community-organized events for AWS enthusiasts to share knowledge and network, with sponsorship packages like Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze offering different benefits. Platinum sponsors receive prominent recognition, customized packages, logo representation, and booth space, Gold sponsors get booth space and logo display, Silver sponsors have a bigger booth and reception sponsoring, and Bronze sponsors receive logo display and recognition during session breaks. Support associations coordinate with sponsors, manage sponsorship packages, and ensure recognition. Local meetups are smaller, frequent gatherings of AWS users, with sponsorships from location and catering sponsors. The AWS Meetup Vienna operates without a legal entity, with sponsors paying directly for needs, ensuring transparency and simplicity.

## Overview

This document provides general guidelines for sponsoring AWS community events, including AWS Community Days and local meetups. It outlines the types of sponsorships available, their benefits, and the role of support associations in organizing these events.

## Sponsorship Opportunities

### Community Days
AWS Community Days are community-organized events that offer a platform for AWS enthusiasts to share knowledge and network. Sponsorship opportunities for these events typically include:

- **Platinum Sponsorship**: Highest level of sponsorship with extensive benefits such as prominent logo placement, booth space, and customized packages.
- **Gold Sponsorship**: Includes benefits like booth space, logo placement, and opportunities to provide swag items.
- **Silver Sponsorship**: Offers benefits such as larger booth space and reception sponsorship.

### Meetup Sponsorship
Local meetups are smaller, more frequent gatherings of AWS users. Sponsorship for these events can take various forms:

- **Location Sponsors**: Local companies can provide venues for meetups, offering their office spaces or other facilities.
- **Catering Sponsors**: Sponsors can cover the costs of food and beverages for the meetup group by directly paying the invoices for catering services.

## General Sponsorship Information

### Importance of Contracts
For large-scale events like AWS Community Days, having formal contracts with sponsors is crucial. Contracts help define the terms and conditions of the sponsorship, including the benefits provided to the sponsor, payment conditions, and any other obligations. This ensures clarity and helps prevent misunderstandings.

### Payment Conditions
Payment conditions should be clearly outlined in the sponsorship contract. This includes the total sponsorship amount, payment schedule, and any penalties for late payments. Sponsors should be informed of the payment methods accepted and any deadlines for payments to ensure smooth financial management of the event.

### Benefits to Sponsors
Sponsors receive various benefits in return for their support, which can include:

- **Brand Visibility**: Logo placement on event materials, websites, and during sessions.
- **Engagement Opportunities**: Booth space, speaking opportunities, and the ability to provide swag items.
- **Networking**: Access to attendees and other sponsors, fostering potential business relationships.

## Support Associations

Support associations play a crucial role in organizing larger events such as AWS Community Days. They manage sponsorships by:

- **Coordinating with sponsors to cover event costs**: This includes negotiating sponsorship packages, managing agreements, and ensuring efficient handling of financial aspects.
- **Ensuring sponsors receive appropriate recognition and benefits**: This can include logo placements, mentions in promotional content, and opportunities to present or host sessions.

By following these guidelines, AWS community events can secure the necessary support to provide valuable experiences for attendees.

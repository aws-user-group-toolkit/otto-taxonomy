# AWS Community Event Sponsorship

## Sponsorship Possibilities

This document outlines the various sponsorship opportunities available for AWS community events, specifically focusing on AWS Community Days and local meetups. It details different sponsorship packages, their benefits, and the role of support associations in organizing these events.

The key difference between the two types of sponsorships mentioned is their scale and structure. AWS Community Day sponsorships are more formal and structured, often involving significant financial contributions and comprehensive benefits packages. In contrast, local meetup sponsorships are smaller in scale, often involving in-kind contributions such as venue provision or catering, with a focus on simplicity and direct payment for specific needs.

### Community Days
AWS Community Days are community-organized events that provide a platform for AWS enthusiasts to come together, share knowledge, and network. Sponsorship opportunities for these events include:

#### Example Sponsorship Packages
While each community event can tailor their sponsorship packages to fit their unique needs and goals, here is an example of how sponsorship packages might be structured for AWS Community Day DACH in Munich. Note that Munich is one of the more expensive cities in Europe, and in regions like Slovakia, where food and location costs may be cheaper and there are fewer attendees, prices and packages might differ. The following example is based on a conference with about 19 sponsors, 10 booths, and 700 attendees.

#### Support Associations
Support associations like the Förderverein AWS Community DACH play a crucial role in organizing larger events such as the AWS Community Day DACH in Munich. These associations are essential for the success of community-driven events, providing both organizational and financial support. They manage sponsorships by:

- **Coordinating with sponsors to cover event costs**: The association works closely with various sponsors to secure the necessary funding for the event. This includes negotiating sponsorship packages, managing sponsor agreements, and ensuring that all financial aspects are handled efficiently. This financial support helps cover venue costs, speaker fees, promotional materials, and other event-related expenses.

- **Ensuring that sponsors receive appropriate recognition and benefits**: In return for their financial support, sponsors are given various forms of recognition and benefits. This can include logo placements on event materials, mentions in promotional content, opportunities to present or host sessions, and access to attendee data (where appropriate and compliant with privacy regulations). The association ensures that sponsors receive the visibility and engagement opportunities they expect, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship.

By handling these responsibilities, support associations like the Förderverein AWS Community DACH enable the AWS community to host impactful and well-organized events that bring together enthusiasts, professionals, and experts to share knowledge and network.

### Meetup Sponsorship
Local meetups are smaller, more frequent gatherings of AWS users. Sponsorship for these events can take various forms:

#### Location Sponsors
Local companies can provide venues for meetups, offering their office spaces or other facilities.

#### Catering Sponsors
Sponsors can cover the costs of food and beverages for the meetup group. Instead of handling money, sponsors directly pay the invoices for catering services.

#### AWS Meetup Vienna
The AWS Meetup Vienna operates without a legal entity, which means they do not handle any money directly. Their sponsorship model includes:

- Allowing sponsors to pay for specific needs directly, such as venue rental or catering.
- Ensuring transparency and simplicity by avoiding financial transactions within the meetup organization.

By leveraging these various sponsorship models, AWS community events can thrive and continue to provide valuable experiences for attendees.

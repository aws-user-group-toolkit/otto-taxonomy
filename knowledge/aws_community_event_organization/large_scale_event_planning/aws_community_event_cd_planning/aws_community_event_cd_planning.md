## Overview of AWS Community Day Planning

AWS Community Day is a community-led mini-conference, typically a full-day event with multiple sessions, tracks, or workshops. Unlike regular meetups, which are shorter and usually have a single track, Community Days are larger in scale and offer a variety of simultaneous sessions catering to different interests.

### Organizing a Community Day

Organizing a Community Day involves several key steps:

1. **Form an Organizing Committee**: Assemble a team of 5-10 community leaders, including AWS User Group leaders from nearby cities and AWS Heroes/Community Builders. Define roles clearly, such as Event Chair, Speaker Coordinator, Sponsor Coordinator, Logistics Manager, Marketing Lead, and Volunteer Manager.

2. **Planning Timeline**: Start planning 6-9 months in advance. Key milestones include securing a venue and date, announcing a Call for Papers/Proposals (CFP) for speakers, closing the CFP and finalizing the agenda, opening registrations, and coordinating logistics in the final month.

3. **Venue and Logistics**: Choose a venue that can support multiple breakout rooms. Ensure the venue has AV support, reliable Wi-Fi, and catering options. Plan for check-in desks, signage, and possibly a sponsor expo area. Consider recording sessions or live streaming them.

4. **Budget & Sponsorship**: Create sponsorship packages and reach out to companies. Common sponsors include AWS partner companies, local startups using AWS, or tech employers. Manage sponsorship carefully and keep track of the budget transparently.

5. **Content and Agenda**: Launch an Open CFP to gather talk submissions. Assemble a speaker selection committee to review and score proposals. Aim for a diverse lineup of speakers and ensure no single speaker dominates the agenda. Plan tracks if necessary.

6. **AWS Coordination**: Reach out to the AWS Community Day Core Team for guidance. Coordinate with a local AWS Community Manager for official support. AWS might provide a keynote speaker or facilitate sponsor connections.

7. **Registrations and Attendance**: Use an event registration system. Decide if the event will be free or low-cost. Promote the event heavily through user groups, social media, AWS mailing lists, and tech media. Highlight the unique aspects of the event.

8. **On the Event Day**: Execute like a professional conference. Have volunteers for

# Large Community Events

In the AWS community, there are two primary types of large-scale events organized by the community itself: **Community Days** and **Community Stages at Summits**. Below is a brief explanation of each:

## Community Days

**Community Days** are full-day events organized by AWS user groups and community leaders. These events are designed to bring together AWS enthusiasts, developers, and experts to share knowledge, network, and learn from each other. Community Days typically feature:

- Keynote presentations by AWS experts and community leaders
- Technical sessions and workshops
- Networking opportunities
- Hands-on labs and demos

These events provide a platform for community members to engage deeply with AWS technologies and best practices.

## Community Stages at Summits

**Community Stages at Summits** are sessions organized by the community during AWS Summits. AWS Summits are large, free events hosted by AWS in various cities around the world. The Community Stages at these summits offer:

- Community-led sessions and presentations
- Opportunities for community members to showcase their projects and experiences
- Interactive discussions and Q&A sessions

These stages provide a unique opportunity for community members to contribute to the broader AWS Summit agenda and share their insights with a larger audience.

Both types of events play a crucial role in fostering a vibrant and engaged AWS community, enabling members to learn, share, and grow together.

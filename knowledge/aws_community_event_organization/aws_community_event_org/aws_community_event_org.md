# AWS Community Event Organization

AWS Community Events are gatherings organized by AWS enthusiasts and professionals to share knowledge, network, and collaborate on AWS-related topics. These events are a great way to learn from experts, meet like-minded individuals, and stay updated on the latest AWS developments.

## Types of AWS Community Events

### AWS User Groups
AWS User Groups are local communities that meet regularly to discuss AWS topics, share best practices, and network. These groups are open to everyone, from beginners to experts.

### AWS Community Days
AWS Community Days are community-organized events that provide a platform for AWS users to come together to network, learn, and share their experiences. These events typically feature technical sessions, workshops, and networking opportunities.

### AWS Meetups
AWS Meetups are informal gatherings where AWS users can discuss specific topics, share experiences, and learn from each other. These events are usually smaller and more focused than Community Days.

### Community Stages at AWS Summits
AWS Summits are free events hosted by AWS that bring the cloud computing community together to connect, collaborate, and learn about AWS. These events feature keynote speakers, technical sessions, and hands-on workshops.
